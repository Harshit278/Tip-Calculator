# Test Cases

### General Cases

-   Check that bill, tip percentage and number of people input is present
-   Check that tip per person and bill per person outputs are present
-   Check that submit button is present
-   Check that bill per person and tip per person changes when submit button is pressed
-   Check that bill is a number with 2 decimal places

-   Check that the program throws an error when tip percent is less than 0 or more than 100
-   Check that the program throws an error when the number of people is 0
-   Check that the program throws an error when the bill is a number but has more than 2 decimal places
-   Check that the program works when the bill is a number but has zero or less than 2 decimal places
